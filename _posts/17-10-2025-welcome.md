This is your first blog post! You can write in Markdown, which is simple and readable.

## Markdown Basics

- **Bold text** with `**text**`
- *Italic text* with `*text*`
- Create links: `[link text](https://example.com)`
- Add images: `![alt text](image-url.jpg)`

## Code Blocks

You can include code:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## More Content

Just keep writing! Each paragraph is separated by a blank line.
